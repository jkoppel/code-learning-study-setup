Welcome to the Codebase Learning Study! We are studying the effectiveness of different kinds of tools and approaches to getting ramped up in a codebase. In this study, you will be given a small (1000-line) implementation of the board game Battleship, and asked to add a feature. An experimenter will be observing and guiding you throughout your study session.

Because this is a study about codebase learning, we can't give you access to the code before your study session begins. However, if you clone this repository and follow the instructions, you should be ready to run the actual code.

# Instructions for everyone

 0. If you are not already familiar with the board game Battleship, then learn about it
 1. Install a version of Python between 3.6 and 3.9.6 if you don't already have one. Note that 
 2. Create a virtualenv with whatever version of Python you are using, e.g.:

> pyenv virtualenv 3.9.6 code-learning-study

 3. Activate the virtualenv

> pyenv activate code-learning-study

 4. Begin installing the requirements to be used in the project

> pip install -r requirements.txt

 5. Fill out the pre-study survey and consent form: https://forms.gle/vJAS8kaQnAFU7AXy9


# Instructions for Group 1


 1. If you don't already have it, install VSCode with the Python plugin

 2. Install the Cody plugin from SourceGraph. (Just the plugin is okay; no need to install the separate Cody app.)

 3. If you haven't already used it, play around some with Cody

# Instructions for Group 2

 1. Install the Cursor IDE (https://cursor.so)
 2. Install the Python plugin in Cursor
 3. Create a Cursor account
 4. Play with the Cursor tutorials

# Instructions for Group 3

 1. If you don't already have it, install VSCode with the Python plugin
